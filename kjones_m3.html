        <h1> My Trip to Europe </h1>

        <p> In the spring of 2019, I took my first over-seas trip to visit my friend, Melanie.  I flew 
        from Kansas City, Missouri to Munich, Germany on February 23rd.  It was afternoon when I got to 
        Munich.  Melanie and her husband, Joe picked me up at the airport and took me to a very famous 
        German pub and restaurant, <span id="hofbräuhaus">_____</span>.  After a delicious dinner we 
        walked around downtown Munich and looked at many old structures including the Marienplatz on the 
        central square.  At nearly midnight we drove to their home in Eschenbach, on the autobahn at nearly 
        115mph.  It was crazy how fast everyone else was driving.
        </p>

        <p> On the 24th I rested and adjusted to the time zone.  We did some light sight-seeing around 
        her home.  On the 25th we drove to Italy.  We stopped at a McDonald’s in Innsbruck, Austria high 
        up in the Austrian Alps.  It was really beautiful.  I remember having some culture shock when 
        trying to use a public restroom at another pit-stop along the way.  You have to pay to use the 
        public toilets and I couldn’t figure out how to flush!  We stayed in Vicenza, Italy and had the 
        best pizza at a small local pizzeria where I tried limoncello for the first time.  
        </p>

        <p> On the 26th we took a train from Vicenza to Florence.  We toured the Accademia Gallery that 
        holds Michelangelo’s David.  We also toured old Florence including an old home of the Medici 
        family and down around the Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral and the Ponte Vecchio Bridge.  We had 
        dinner on the <span id="palazzoVecchio">_____</span> as the sun set.   We took the train back to 
        Vicenza late that night.
        </p>

        <p> On the 27th we took a train to Venice where we saw the sights, and took a gondola ride out to 
        the main channel.  It was during Carnival, so I saw some amazing costumes on the 
        <span id="piazzaSanMarco">_____</span>.  I loved all of the warm colors in the morning sun, and it 
        was very quiet early in the day.  There were a few musicians out playing in the narrow streets but 
        otherwise it was quiet until about 3pm.  It felt like it was just us and the locals.  We took a train 
        back to Vicenza that night and on the morning of the 28th we drove back to Melanie’s home in Germany, 
        passing through the Dolomite Mountains, the Alps and through many small towns with church towers, old 
        castles and vineyards along the way. 
        </p>

        <p> March 1st, we drove to Rothenberg, Germany.  Rothenberg was, by surprise, one of my favorite 
        parts of my trip.  It was very quaint and quiet.  We walked the old cobblestone streets and shopped 
        in a few stores including, <span id="katheWohlfahrt">_____</span> and had lunch in a cute little shop.  
        I really enjoyed all of Germany much more than I realized I would.  It is beautiful and clean.  Everyone 
        had good manners and I loved the old-world feel. 
        </p>

        <p> On the 2nd we visited Neuschwanstein Castle, home of King Ludwig II of Bavaria, in Southwest 
        Bavaria.  We took a horse carriage from the base of the mountain up to the fairytale castle, it was 
        beautiful! 
        </p>

        <p> We rested at Melanie’s on the 3rd, and she and her husband drove me back to Munich the morning of 
        the 4th to catch my flight home on March 4th. 
        </p>
